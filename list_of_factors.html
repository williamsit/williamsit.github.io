                        at their different latitudes should exhibit varying maximum temperatures. But what exactly is the relationship between latitude and a city's maximum temperature? Is there
                        a direct correlation between the two? Or is there an inverse relationship between a city's latitude and its maximum temperature? These are the questions that I will
